[{"Title": "Affine sets and affine hulls (revisited)", "Label": "pm-es-affineHullProblem", "Tags": ["Ensemble spaces", "Convex spaces", "Affine spaces"], "Description": "In the context of ensemble spaces, we have defined closures in terms of convex combinations. It may be useful to also define closures in terms of affine combinations. It needs to be understood whether this is useful, and how to make sure that these closures work for infinite dimensional spaces."}]
